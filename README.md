Project Portfolio: Movies Dataset and SQL Queries

Introduction
This project portfolio showcases my proficiency in SQL and data analysis using a movies dataset and a related directors dataset. Through a series of well-structured SQL queries, I have explored and extracted valuable insights from these datasets, demonstrating my ability to work with real-world data to derive meaningful information.

Project Description

Dataset Overview
Movies Dataset: This dataset contains comprehensive information about various movies, including attributes such as original title, budget, popularity, release date, revenue, and more.

Directors Dataset: The directors dataset complements the movies dataset by providing details about directors, including their names, genders, and departments.

Objectives
The main objectives of this project were:

To extract relevant information from the movies and directors datasets.
To perform data analysis tasks, including filtering, sorting, and aggregation.
To answer specific questions and derive insights from the data.
To demonstrate proficiency in SQL and database querying.
Methodology
I achieved the project objectives by crafting a series of SQL queries, each designed to address a specific aspect of the dataset. Here is an overview of the queries I implemented:

List of Movies: Displayed all information available in the movies table.
List of Directors: Presented all information available in the directors table.
Movie Titles: Retrieved a list of all movie titles.
Directors in Alphabetical Order: Listed the names of all directors in alphabetical order.
Movies Released After 2010: Identified movies released after the year 2010.
Highly Rated Movies: Displayed movies with a voting average above 5.0, sorted by vote average.
Movies by Director: Listed are movies directed by a specific director, ordered by release year.
Top-Rated Director: I found the director with the highest vote average movie rating.
Directors and Their Movies: Presented director names along with the titles of their movies.
Top 5 Prolific Directors: Identified and ranked the top 5 directors with the most movies in the dataset.
Results

Through the execution of these queries, I have successfully extracted valuable insights from the movies dataset and presented them in a clear and organized manner. Some notable results include:

A list of highly-rated movies with voting averages above 5.0.
Identification of top directors with the most movies in the dataset.
Sorting of movies by release year and vote average.
A display of directors and their respective movies.
Conclusion
This project portfolio demonstrates my ability to work with SQL and real-world datasets, showcasing skills such as data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, and result presentation. It serves as evidence of my data analysis capabilities and can be a valuable asset when pursuing opportunities in data-related roles.




Additional Questions and Insights

In addition to the primary objectives, we also looked more closely at our movie dataset and found some intriguing results:

Total Films: We have a sizable and varied collection of films in our dataset.

The movies in our collection have, on average, garnered decent ratings, indicating overall quality.

Highest Rated Film: Among the films in our dataset, one stood out as having the highest rating.

Average Rating by Director: In order to assess each director's directing abilities, we looked at how well their films were generally regarded.

Number of Films Produced by Each Director: Some directors have produced an impressively high number of films.

The number of films released each year has been trending, with some years being especially active in terms of new releases.

Highest Rated Film by Director: To highlight each director's outstanding work, we determined their highest-rated films.

These new revelations deepen our comprehension of the movie dataset and show my capacity to glean insightful knowledge from data.
